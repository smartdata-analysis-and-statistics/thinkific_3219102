# Learning Objectives

After completing this practical, learners will be able to:

* Explain how indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) extend traditional pairwise meta-analysis.
* Describe the consistency assumption that links direct and indirect evidence.
* Recognize when the consistency assumption may be violated and what this implies.
* Construct a simple evidence network and interpret the implications for treatment comparisons.
