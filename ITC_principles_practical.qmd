This exercise helps you **familiarize yourself with the principles of indirect and mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs)**.  
Youâ€™ll use a simple, real-data-inspired example involving **Semaglutide**, **Liraglutide**, and **Placebo**, and visualize the treatment network using the `multinma` package in R.

Although the data have been slightly simplified for illustration, the reported treatment effects are based on estimates published in  
[*Nature Medicine* (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03978-z)

## ðŸ“Š Background

In this example, two clinical trials each compared an active treatment with **Placebo**.  
Weâ€™d like to understand how **Semaglutide** performs relative to **Liraglutide**, even though no head-to-head trial was conducted.

| Comparison             | Effect Size | Error Variance | 95% CI (approx.)     |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Liraglutide vs Placebo  | 4.53        | 0.26           | (3.56, 5.55)         |
| Semaglutide vs Placebo  | 10.02       | 1.78           | (7.40, 12.63)        |

Each value represents the **mean percentage difference in total body weight loss** versus placebo.

These effect sizes were derived from studies summarized in the Nature Medicine paper cited above.  
Weâ€™ll now use them to estimate the **indirect comparison** between the two active drugs.
